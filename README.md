This is a repository for JavaScript functions. Think of it as a package manager---like NPM or Bower---but just for *functions* rather than libraries or components. For more on the motivation behind this project, see my post [*Functions over (JavaScript) libraries*](http://danieltao.com/ideas/functions-over-libraries). Briefly, here are some goals:

## Web UI

- [x] allow users to specify and/or implement specific functionality.
- [ ] let users vote on different implementations of the same spec
- [ ] display charts indicating popularity and benchmark results for top implementations

## API

- [ ] provide a JavaScript library for specifying dependencies on certain functions

This is seriously like the fifth time I've started on this idea. Don't get your hopes up.
